# Design Proposal for POSIX File Socket Support in Boost.Asio

## Introduction
This document outlines the proposed changes to the Boost.Asio library to add support for POSIX file sockets. The goal is to extend the existing socket interface to handle file descriptors, enabling file-based communication using the Asio framework.

## Background
Currently, Boost.Asio provides robust support for network sockets through classes such as `basic_raw_socket`, `basic_socket_acceptor`, and `basic_stream_socket`. These classes are templates with `Protocol` and `Executor` parameters, allowing for flexibility in their use.

## Proposed Changes

### New Protocol Type
- Define a new protocol type within the Asio framework specifically for file sockets, similar to existing protocols like TCP or UDP.
- This new protocol will encapsulate the specifics of file socket communication.

### Socket Class Extensions
- Extend the existing socket classes or create new classes to handle file descriptors:
  ```cpp
  template <typename Executor>
  class basic_file_socket : public basic_socket<file_protocol, Executor>
  ```
- Implement file-specific versions of key methods:
  - send/async_send
  - receive/async_receive
  - connect/async_connect (for named pipes)
  - bind (for creating named pipes)

### File Socket Operations
- Implement operations for opening, closing, reading, and writing to file sockets.
- Add support for asynchronous I/O operations for file sockets.
- Introduce new operations specific to file sockets, such as seek and truncate.

### Integration with Asio Service Framework
- Ensure that the new file socket classes work with the existing Asio service framework for seamless integration.
- Adapt the service implementation to support file descriptors:
  ```cpp
  std::size_t s = this->impl_.get_service().send(
      this->impl_.get_implementation(), buffers, 0, ec);
  ```

### Asynchronous Model Compatibility
- Maintain compatibility with the existing asynchronous model:
  ```cpp
  return async_initiate<WriteToken,
    void (asio::error_code, std::size_t)>(
      initiate_async_send(this), token,
      buffers, socket_base::message_flags(0));
  ```

## Implementation Considerations
- Implement file descriptor support in the underlying implementation.
- Handle the differences between file and network socket behaviors, such as EOF conditions.
- Consider the impact on existing abstractions like buffers and completion tokens.

## Compatibility and Testing
- Verify that the new feature is compatible with the existing library.
- Develop a comprehensive testing strategy:
  - Write unit tests for the new file socket functionality.
  - Create regression tests to ensure existing features are not affected.
  - Test edge cases specific to file operations (e.g., seek beyond file size, read/write permissions).

## Performance Considerations
- Analyze and optimize performance for file socket operations.
- Compare performance with native file I/O operations to ensure efficiency.

## Documentation and Examples
- Update Boost.Asio documentation to include file socket usage.
- Provide example code demonstrating how to use file sockets with the library.

## Conclusion
The addition of POSIX file socket support will enhance the Boost.Asio library by providing a unified interface for both network and file-based communication. This extension will maintain the library's existing design principles while offering new capabilities for developers working with file-based IPC mechanisms.
